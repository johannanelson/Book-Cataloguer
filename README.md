# Book-Cataloguer

Program that catalogs any txt file (intended for books or articles) by its diction. Can either generate a list of words used and their usage numbers, or search for a specific word. I've always found repeated metaphors and epithets interesting, and wanted a simple way to find all their instances â€“ sort of like command-f, but getting all the instances in one output file.
